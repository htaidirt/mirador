# Mirador

Mirador runs automatically mocha tests when any file in the project changes.

## Install

Use npm to install globally _Mirador_

    npm install -g mirador

## Dependencies

_Mirador_ needs _mocha_, of course, to run your tests.

A further version will be able to accept any test engine.

In addition to _mocha_, _Mirador_ needs _watch_ module in order to track changes on your project.

## Use

Just run `mirador` in the root folder of your project.

Any time your save your work, _mirador_ triggers the tests. Just see your terminal to see the passing and failing tests.

To quit, just use `^C` in your terminal.
